  Position model and move rules for Catenary backgammon.

  ## Position model

  A position is **actor-relative**: points are numbered `1..24` from the
  acting player's perspective (`1` is their home/1-point, `24` their
  opponent's 1-point), and a point holds a **signed count** — positive =
  the actor's checkers, negative = the opponent's. The bar and bear-off
  counts are kept separately for each side (`bar`/`opp_bar`, `off`/`opp_off`).

  After a turn the position is `mirror/1`ed so the next mover reads an
  identical board from their own side (the standard backgammon convention,
  also how Magriel notation works).

  ## Rules

  * A die moves a checker from point `p` to `p - die` (down toward home);
    a landing point must be vacant, the actor's own point, or hold exactly
    one opponent checker (a hit sends that checker to the opponent's bar).
  * While any of the actor's checkers is on the bar, every die must re-enter
    at point `25 - die` and no other move is legal.
  * Bearing off is legal only when every actor checker is in the home board
    (points `1..6`) and the bar is clear. A die `d` may bear off a checker
    from the **highest** occupied point `p <= d` (standard precedence: you
    can't bear a lower checker while a higher one is reachable by the die).
  * `legal_plays/2` enumerates every **maximal** play for a roll; a play is
    maximal when no remaining die can be used.
  * `legal_play?/3` validates a specific move sequence against a position and
    roll (each move implies its own die by geometry) and insists the play is
    maximal — shared by the per-turn verifier and the interactive UI.
